    <h1>
      Hi, I’m <span>Giancarla</span>!
    </h1>
    <p>
      I design and build human-centered technical systems at the intersection of engineering and product.
  My work spans computer architecture, embedded systems, product strategy, and UI/UX design — translating complex systems into usable, thoughtful experiences.

          <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
          <p>
            User-centered design case studies focused on research synthesis, low-fidelity prototyping,
            interaction flows, and reducing user uncertainty in high-stakes decision contexts.

          <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
          <p>
  I like building things, learning new skills, and getting a little better at them each time. The work here reflects that mindset — structured when it needs to be, creative when it can be.

      <h2>On Iteration & Growth</h2>
  
      <p>
        Design is iterative by nature. While the work showcased here reflects my thinking and process at different stages, I’m constantly refining how I approach clarity, usability, and system behavior.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        If you notice areas that could be improved, whether it be interaction details, visual hierarchy, user flows, or edge cases, I would genuinely love to talk about them. Thoughtful critique is one of the most valuable parts of growing as a designer and engineer.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I’m always open to conversations about what works, what doesn’t, and how systems can be made more intuitive and human-centered.
